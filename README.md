# Coding Tasks

A collection of coding tasks in multiple languages.
Some examples:

## Banking Sim
A simple command-line banking application developed in C++. It allows users to manage various types of bank accounts, including current accounts, savings accounts, and ISAs. Through a straightforward command interface, users can perform operations such as opening accounts, viewing balances and transaction histories, making deposits and withdrawals, transferring funds between accounts, projecting future balances, and searching transaction histories.

## Naughts and Crosses vs AI
A simple python command-line implementation of naughts and crosses as well as a version with additional rules. The game allows you to play agaisnt human or AI. The additional rules include being able to place either an x or an o and being able to move pieces instead of placing a new one down.

## Card game and shuffle
A C# implementation of a card game simulation. The game involves a human player vs a computer competing using a standard deck of 52 cards. The application starts and the user is presented with a menu that allows them to view the current deck, shuffle the deck, start a new game, or quit the program. During gameplay, both players are dealt ten cards each. In each round, players select two cards from their hand to play. The player with the higher total value of the selected cards wins the trick. The game continues until one player accumulates a total of 3 tricks, or there are no more cards left to play.

## Searches and Sorts
A C# application designed for sorting and searching data from text files that outputs amount of steps for various searching and sorting algorithms. The program reads data from multiple files and performs a user chosen sorting algorithms on the data. Then the user can choose a search algorithm to search for a specific entry. The sorting algorithm are bubble sort, insertion sort, and merge sort, and the searching algorithms are linear and binary search.
